# Timeseries Demo

###Intro

This is the first time I play around with data visualization using web technologies. This program plots a time series dataset into a line chart and demonstrates the behaviors of filtering algorithms on a noisy dataset. 

###Libraries Used
- `c3`: Charting library.
- `timeseries-analysis`: Moving average filter and John Ehlers' iTrend.
- `kalmanjs`: 1D Kalman filter.
